"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."
-Marcus Aurelius

"Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been."
-Marcus Aurelius

"Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love—something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid."
-Marcus Aurelius

"Indifference to external events. And a commitment to justice in your own acts."
-Marcus Aurelius

"As you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper to yourself, “He may be dead in the morning.”"

"If what you are doing isn't working, try something different."
-Robert Glover

"Be who you are without reservations. Let others know you, even what you think it's bad. People connect through shared problems and characteristics."
-Robert Glover

"But it was more than that. Being honest wasn't just about telling the truth and being direct to girls - it was also about being honest to myself, and owning everything about who I was. I wasn't looking for anything serious at that point in my life, I just wanted to get drunk and fuck a bunch of different girls. Once I figured that out and admitted it to myself - which I hadn't done in America, but did do in Cancun - everything changed. By being honest with myself about what I wanted, it freed me up to be honest and direct to girls… and as a result, I got way more pussy with much less effort."
-Tucker Max

"Once these two things combined in me - complete honesty and not caring about the results - the world changed overnight."
-Tucker Max

"To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, —that is genius."

"If you get easily bored, it means that your BS detector is functioning properly; if you forget (some) things, it means that your minds know how to filter; and if you feel sadness, it means that you are human."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"What we commonly call "success" (rewards, status, recognition, some new metric) is a consolation prize for those both unhappy and not good at what they do."

-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"By setting oneself totally free of constraints, free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free of efforts, elements hidden in the texture of reality start staring at you; then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in front of your eyes."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"Consider that all the wealth of the world can't buy a liquid more pleasurable than water after intense thirst. Few objects bring more thrill than a recovered wallet (or laptop) lost on a train. The essence of life is some volatility."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"Some people play the game too seriously; they are paid to read too much into it."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"Work ethics draw people to focus on noise rather than the signal."

"I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"We know more than we think we do, a lot more than we can articulate."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"The same or a similar mechanism of overcompensation makes us concentrate better in the presence of a modicum of background random noise, as if the act of countering such noise helps us hone our mental focus."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"In the complex world, the notion of “cause” itself is suspect; it is either nearly impossible to detect or not really defined—another reason to ignore newspapers, with their constant supply of causes for things."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"At the present time, one person is dying of diabetes every seven seconds, but the news can only talk about victims of hurricanes with houses flying in the air."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"Since procrastination is a message from our natural willpower via low motivation, the cure is changing the environment, or one’s profession, by selecting one in which one does not have to fight one’s impulses."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"If you “have optionality,” you don’t have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, and these complicated things that take place in our brain cells. For you don’t have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"But I read voraciously, wholesale, initially in the humanities, later in mathematics and science, and now in history—outside a curriculum, away from the gym machine so to speak. I figured out that whatever I selected myself I could read with more depth and more breadth—there was a match to my curiosity."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"The minute I was bored with a book or a subject I moved to another one, instead of giving up on reading altogether—when you are limited to the school material and you get bored, you have a tendency to give up and do nothing or play hooky out of discouragement. - The trick is to be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading. So the number of pages absorbed could grow faster than otherwise. And you find gold, so to speak, effortlessly, just as in rational but undirected trial-and-error-based research. It is exactly like options, trial and error, not getting stuck, bifurcating when necessary but keeping a sense of broad freedom and opportunism."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"If true wealth consists in worry-less sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal gratitude, absence of envy, good appetite, muscle strength, physical energy, frequent laughs, no meals alone, no gym class, some physical labor (or hobby), good bowel movements, no meeting rooms, and periodic surprises, then it is largely subtractive (elimination of iatrogenics)."
-Nassim Nicholas Taleb

"The more you watch impartially – accepting what is seen just for what it is – the better your mind/body is likely to behave."
-Fuck it

"What tends to happen is that the more you value yourself, the more the rest of the world will tend to agree and value you as well."
-Fuck it

"So say Fuck It to whatever you want to be. And just be who you are. There is no need to be anything else. There is no need to self-develop, or improve. There is no need to be like anyone else."
-Fuck it

"So just say Fuck It to it all. Just do what the hell you want. Try not to set up daily tasks for yourself to get fitter or thinner or smarter (though we all still will, of course). Once you lose the tension of these self-imposed expectations, you will feel so much freer."
-Fuck it

"When you really know what you want (through relaxing), it’s very difficult for change not to happen quite naturally."
-Fuck it

"The less you search, the more you find. The less you want, the more you receive. The less you look, the more you see."
-Fuck it

"If we find the courage to loosen our hold on things … to stop wanting things so much … to stop working so hard and striving so much … to give up some of the things that matter to us … something magical happens: We naturally start getting what we originally wanted, but without the effort."
-Fuck it

"The most important metric to track is your personal energy."
-Scott Adams

"Happiness is health plus freedom."
-Scott Adams

"In hindsight, it looks as if the projects I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success."
-Scott Adams

"As I write this paragraph, my wife and our good friends are wondering why I’m selfishly lagging behind and not meeting them for an afternoon of sitting in the sun. I’ll get there soon. And when I do, I’ll feel energized and satisfied and be far more fun to be around."
-Scott Adams

"Smiling makes you feel better even if your smile is fake."
-Scott Adams

"The ability to mix technical knowledge with solving real-world problems is the key, not sheer number-crunching or programming for its own sake. Number-crunching skills will be turned over to the machines sooner or later."
-Tyler Cowen

"Be honest with yourself about who you are, and have the courage to be that person. If you want to fuck, then go fuck. If you want to get drunk, get drunk. And there is nothing wrong with sucking a dick. If someone tries to judge you or shame you for doing safe, consensual things that make you happy, I can guarantee you they’re a bad person–tell them to lick the dark part of your ass and cut them out of your life. No one has it all figured out, especially not the people who are acting like they do and judging you because of it. Pretending to be something you aren’t because you’re trying to please a bunch of judgmental hypocrites and shitheads is not the way to be happy; living the life you want to live is. It’s that simple."
-Tucker Max

"I wasn’t afraid to be honest in my writing, exposing both the good AND the bad about myself in an authentic, raw and compelling way. Do that thing–be painfully honest–and you’ll get there, because no one else does it. Everyone in the world is a liar, whether its to themselves or to everyone else, they’re all full of shit. If you have the courage to tell the truth, to open your soul to the world, even a little bit, the world will stop and look."
-Tucker Max

"Once those things combined in me–complete honesty and not caring about the results–the world changed overnight."
-Tucker Max

"Doing what you’re supposed to do does not make you a good person. There’s no one keeping track, ready to award you a special ribbon for staying inside the most lines. Write your own rules. Forget the bullshit ones (dress code, hours, hierarchy etc), follow the critical ones (getting results, never offend the wrong person) and do whatever you want. Seriously."
-Ryan Holiday

"Once I got my own stuff going on - my business, staff, students - I stopped to be concerned with what’s on Hacker News. That was a huge turning point for me, because I realized I could make my OWN LIFE interesting instead of waiting for some random post on HN or counting likes on Facebook and them doing nothing."
-Ramit Sethi

"When I’m reading a book or watching a presentation, I always ask myself “How this apply to me? What can I take out of this?”, and write it down on real paper."
-Naveen Dittakavi

"You can have everything you want in life if you will just help other people get what they want."
-Zig Ziglar

"Figure out how to motivate people and get them to feel good about themselves. Everyone in the future economy – from doctors to educators to entrepreneurs – will be coaches."
-Tyler Cowen

"Accept who you are in full. If you don’t like traveling, don’t spend time or energy feeling you “should” do it or even trying to do more of it. When you stop trying to be someone else, you suddenly have a lot more time and energy."
-Gretchen Rubin

"People are waiting to be led."
-BJ Fogg

"If you can properly phrase the question, then the answer is the easy part."
-Elon Musk

"It's very striking and powerful when you realize that many successful people are just ordinary folks without unnecessary negative self-talk who just worked at it for 10 or 20 years."
-vijucat (HN)

"A writer told me, “I didn’t get anything done today.” Answer: try to do nothing. The best way to have only good days is to not aim at getting anything done. Actually almost everything I’ve written that has survived was written when I didn’t try to get anything done."
-Nassim Taleb

"Change your anchor to what did not happen rather than what did happen."
-Nassim Taleb

“It is much better to do things you cannot explain than explain things you cannot do."

"LEARNING TO DO NOTHING (Idleness as a BS detector/cleaner) - At the start of this year I resolved to do "nothing except if it felt like a hobby" i.e., "satisfy interests while providing entertainment value with zero pressure, no schedule and no feeling of duty". The rule is to wake up with the aim to "do nothing", have nothing scheduled and avoid the usual guilt (or shame) encountered by most when "wasting time", have minimum committments and talk to NO journalist. Of course, cut everything unpleasant, no matter what the potential gain. Treat everything (including mathematics) the way a great-uncle of mine who was a man of leisure treated his afternoon game of bridge: intellectual concentration as entertainment.
RESULT: 12 academic papers (9 accepted so far), finished a book (Silent Risk)--well, almost, wrote 100 aphorisms, ate 2 Beijing ducks, learned to typeset books as a self-standing publisher, found 4 investments ... and this is 3/4 of the year.
NOTE: To do things make sure you have no assistant. They drag you into doing things for the sake of "work”."

"My main life lesson from investing: self-interest is the most powerful force on earth, and can get people to embrace and defend almost anything."
-Jesse Livermore

"The hardest lesson I’ve had to learn in my life is that my intelligence is inversely correlated to my humility. The more I thought I knew, the less I actually knew."

"I am not young enough to know everything."

"Imagination is more important than knowledge"
-Albert Einstein

"You teach best what you most need to learn."

"Real confidence only comes from demonstrated performance."
-Tucker Max

"Having genuine, long-lasting confidence requires you to increase your competence. This cannot be done through self-affirmations, visualizations, positive thinking, or other emotional boosters. Increasing confidence is done through better preparation (a.k.a. practice) and performance."
-Tucker Max

"The moment when I realized that my goal going out was to get as much fun as possible, I got three times the amount of sex with half the work."
-Tucker Max

"Although we are repeatedly told that exceptional achievers owe their success to their high confidence or self-belief, it is more feasible to attribute it to their insecurity — why else would anybody work so hard, and continue to work hard even after accomplishing much more than most people?"
-Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic

"Whatever you’re not confident about: just start in the smallest way that’s possible and just go up and up and up. Want to be confident around women? Go talk to your grandma for 3 fucking hours, then to random old ladies, then to clerks at grocery stores… treat them like real people, don’t try to hit on them, just talk and get comfortable."
-Tucker Max

"Shipping things that are unambiguously valuable generates significantly more interesting and high-return opportunities than exposing yourself to lots of different people and ideas."
-Cal Newport

"When you find yourself hating someone (who did not directly hurt you) with blinding rage, know for certain that it is not the person you hate at all, but rather something about them that threatens your identity. Find that thing. This single piece of advice can turn your life around, I guarantee it."
-The Last Psychiatrist

"Don't try to be original. Just try to be good. That sounds sort of naïve, but it's true."
-Paul Rand

"I’m a huge believer that one of the best ways to figure out what you think is to write it out and then iterate. When you do this, you quickly discover how foggy your ideas are, and you work to clarify them."
-Ben Casnocha

"You change the world not by trying to alter what already exists, but by building new things that are better than what currently exists. Apply this to your life, even at the micro level: Are you fighting a hard battle by trying to fix something that is probably unfixable…or are you building something new and better to replace it?"
-Tucker Max

"Seeking advice is addicting and can become a proxy for action."
-Frank Chimero

"You should write the book you would want to read, not the one you believe you should write."

-Alain de Botton

"We should keep a careful diary of our moments of envy: they are our covert guides to what we should try to do next."
-Alain de Botton

"The hope on picking up a book: it will tell us what we already feel and intuit but haven't had time to think."
-Alain de Botton

"An opinion (e.g. professional criticism) is nothing more than a projection of the self."
-Tucker Max

"If your listeners don't know what to do to make money, I'll tell you right now: The next 20 years are going to see an explosion of people explaining, simplifying and curating very complex subjects for the average person. Do that well, and you'll be rich and famous."
-Tucker Max

"If you can take Buddhism and turn it into something that someone who shops at target can understand, then you're Ekhart Tole."
-Tucker Max

"I like giving advice to people, for many reasons. It's rewarding to help people, and thinking through things in order to teach someone else often sharpens the insights in my own. Plus, I know what it's like to feel lost and alone and desperately want someone with experience to give you some guidance."
-Tucker Max

"If you want to change the game--WHY ARE YOU NOT ALREADY DOING IT? Where is your writing? Dude, you ignored the most important part of my email: Where is your audience, in ANY medium? All you did was tell me how great your story is. No one cares about all of that bullshit. It's just a bunch of ideas. Everyone has ideas. Potential = NOTHING. Actual is all that matters."
-Tucker Max

"The real reason I’ve sold millions of books and inpired countless people is because I'll say and do the things they want to do and say, but don't feel like they can. You know what that is? Courage."
-Tucker Max

"You decide who you become by what you do. The accumulation of decisions you make about where you focus your time and effort is what determines who you ultimately become. Decide who you want to be in the future, then start acting like him or her right now."
-Tucker Max

“This is why almost every good manager/coach of sports teams were very mediocre players: they HAD to understand everything about the sport to eek out every advantage just to compete with the great athletes."
-Tucker Max

"I think the key thing that I finally started to understand was not just business, but how the world actually worked. I stopped getting pissed and railing at people or systems that I thought were unfair, and instead focused on doing the job at hand. I think the big shift for me emotionally was asking myself the question, "Do you want to be angry at the injustice and fail because of that, or do you want to go around their bullshit, be effective at what matters, and succeed?”"
-Tucker Max

"I don’t have a 5-year plan; instead, every day I wake up and work on things that are important to me."
-Ryan Holiday

"Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family."
-Don Corleone

"I don't trust society to protect us, I have no intention of placing my fate in the hands of men whose only qualification is that they managed to con a block of people to vote for them."
-Michael Corleone

"It’s not about how much you sleep. It’s what you do while you’re awake."
-Gary Vaynerchuk

"You never create success by doing what was successful last time. You create success by figuring out how to combine the need that someone have and how you can meet that need."
-Tucker Max

"Even very successful creatives fight everyday that urge to sit down and do nothing. The ones who succeed are the ones who get up and fight that urge."
-Tucker Max

"Everyone wants change, but very few people want to put in the work necessary to change because it’s hard and painful. When people say ‘I want to change,’ what they really mean is ‘I want change to happen to my life.’ They don’t want to actually do it."
-Tucker Max

"If what you say you want and what you’re doing are in opposite directions, than you have something emotional / internal to deal with or you don’t know what you really want."
-Tucker Max

“You know why do people spend so much time doing pointless things like creating business cards or reading a book about sales instead of just finding customers and trying to make a sale? Because you can’t fail at business cards; you can’t fail at reading a book."
-Tucker Max

"The only thing that you should be ashamed of is not working hard to improve the areas of your life that aren’t what you want. And if you aren’t doing it, you need to sit down and figure out why:
1. What am I trying to accomplish? What is your goal? (Start small)
2. Why am I doing this?
3. What’s the measurement for when you have succeeded?
4. How are you going to do this? What is the plan? (Actions)
5. What is the accountability?"
-Tucker Max

"To a large extent, your thoughts are a choice… your logical thoughts are definitely a choice. That’s why you focus on reason and logic so much because your emotional life is so chaotic and painful, and you can’t control it. So you focus on what you can control, your rational thoughts. I do that a lot too. It’s a recipe for disaster."
-Tucker Max

"Your goal is to like you as much as she likes you."
-Nils Parker

"Executed effectively, a passion for helping people makes more money than a passion for money."

"Every startup solving a trivial problem is delight for its customers and rent and groceries paid for its people."
-Benedict Evans

"I hate "I'm looking for an idea." I'd look for an inefficiency, and pretend you're a ruthless capitalist with access to for loops and SQL."
-Patrick McKenzie

"Smile at the customer. Take the initiative. Tweak a few rules. Steal cookies for your colleagues. Don’t puncture the impression that you know what you’re doing. Let the other person fill the silence. Get comfortable with discomfort. Don’t privilege your own feelings. Ask who you’re really protecting. Be tough and humane. Challenge ideas, not the people who hold them. Don’t be a slave to type. And above all, don’t affix nasty, scatological labels to people."
-The Atlantic, Why It Pays to Be a Jerk (sometimes)

"What if, rather than asking the traditional question—What tasks currently performed by humans will soon be done more cheaply and rapidly by machines?—we ask a new one: What new feats might people achieve if they had better thinking machines to assist them?"
-Thomas Davenport

"Inconsistency is everywhere when you actually track successful people for long enough and notice the patterns. Be willing to change your mind and to appear indecisive and inconsistent."
-Joel Gascoigne

"Usage is like oxygen for ideas. You can never fully anticipate how an audience is going to react to something youve created until its out there. You can’t learn by planning."
-Matt Mullenweg

"Build half a product, not a half-ass product."
-Jason Fried

"Most people don’t get those experiences because they never ask. I’ve never found anybody that didn’t want to help me if I asked them for help."
-Steve Jobs

"You don't set out to build a wall. You don't say 'I'm going to build the biggest, baddest, greatest wall that's ever been built.' You don't start there. You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall."
-Will Smith

"In order to succeed, we probably should think and execute on a smaller level."
-Joel Gascoigne

"It is not joy that makes us grateful. It is gratitude that makes us joyful."

-Joel Gascoigne

"Do what you want. Build something that the thought of makes you jump out of bed each morning. Test the assumptions and make changes based on what was incorrect, but out of the possible options for the next path, choose to first try the path which maximizes your excitement."
-Joel Gascoigne

"You tell the world how to treat you."
-Tucker Max

"It’s an interesting social dynamic: people can say and do the craziest things, but if they just own it, they can get away with it and everything’s cool… but when you’re afraid or ashamed of what you’re doing or saying, people pick up on that."
-Charlie Hoehn

"If I had an hour to save the world, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem & one minute finding the solution."

"Small quotas (i.e. tiny habits) make each day approachable. Big goals make the pursuit worthwhile."
-Gregory Ciotti

"Amor Fati: Find joy in everything that happens."
-Ryan Holiday

"Labels can become self-fulfilling, even if they are bullshit and not true at all. Lots of research shows that negative stereotypes about your sex or race – girls can’t do math, blacks are not smart, white men can’t jump – is enough to cause self-doubt for these groups in those activities, use up critical brain resources, and result in choking and lower performance."
-Choke

"The labels you put on yourself a self-fulfilling prophecy because your actions will follow those beliefs, whether or not they are objectively true."
-Choke

"Practicing under the exact conditions you will face in a do-or-die situation is exactly what is needed to perform your best when the stress is on. Get used to the pressure so it is not something you fear."
-Choke

"Writing for 10 minutes about your worries before a date or social situation can help thwart the anxieties and self-doubt that will often emerge."
-Choke

"Before a high-stakes situation (a blind first date) spend a couple of minutes writing about your many interests and activities. This writing can promote feelings of self-worth. Reaffirming yourself, especially when you question your abilities, can boost confidence and performance. Before going out, spend 5 minutes drawing a diagram of everything that makes you a multifaceted individual. This exercise can help to highlight that your performance that night doesn’t define you, which can in turn take some of the pressure off."
-Choke

"With accomplishments comes confidence and with confidence comes belief. It has to be in that order."
-Mike Krzyzewski

"If any good opportunity to write comes my way, I almost always say yes, even if I don’t think I’d possibly have the time to. What I’ve come to find is I always find the time, and it’s in stretching my limits that I become a better writer. When other people are depending on me for my work, I’m not going to let them down; but when it’s an internal, personal commitment, that’s when the excuses and the Resistance start to creep in.” (He doesn’t self-publish because he needs the external motivation to finish his books.)

"I live my days as if I will live forever. Putting off so much, expecting there to be more time, another chance. If I accepted my mortality to my core, never knowing when the chain snaps, then how would I live? More on my terms. A free man. I’d write more, I’d love more, I’d laugh more."

"Bandini, the subject of the series, is a wonderful example of someone whose actual life is ruined by the fantasies in his head–every second he spends stuck up there is one he wastes and spoils in real life. He’s too caught up and delusional to see that his problems are his fault, that he’s vicious because he can’t live up to the impossible expectations they create, and that he could have everything he wants if he calmed down and lived in reality for a second."

"There are few things in life more important than choosing one's peer group well. The Internet gives you many more options than we had available prior to the existence of it. Choose wisely and re-evaluate that choice periodically to see whether your peer group continues to represent your goals and values. Why? Your peer group literally gets arbitrary code execution on your brain. (It's a flaw in MonkeyBrainOS 1.01 which we haven't patched yet.) You'll tend to find yourself valuing what they value. You will tend to find yourself achieving outcomes strikingly similar to their outcomes."

"I think you are the person who has achieved the most here on hacker news. You lack the ego of a lot of the people who are constantly writing advice articles on how to run a startup (where they don't even have a startup). And you started with small doable things, and worked your way up to a pretty high income (for where you live). The courage to go through this, and the lack of ego in selecting the products is quite inspiring for me. I think people like you should be our real heros, not the people who constantly write comments for upvotes and write fluffy articles about startups."

"I think a good, but unending job is to endeavor so that no one ever questions something about your life that you haven’t already fully turned over in your head from every possible angle. That you should never realize something about yourself in some momentous epiphany because you’ve institutionalized incremental reflection."
-Ryan Holiday

"People hurt. People are messed up. People are stuck in patterns and don’t even know they are pattens. Most of what we do is not malicious, not stupid, not selfish or ignorant. Is is, instead, a response to events whose significance we often don’t even recall. The next time you look down on someone else’s behavior—the next time you think, Oh, here we go again or _________ always does this—try to remember that. Remember that these aren’t just little personality quirks, but real feelings masked by annoying actions. These are people in pain, like we are in pain—even if it makes them act like a dick. Don’t hate or pity or pander to them. But let it remind you that they’re human."
-Ryan Holiday

"Most importantly, remember that you are not special. There were a million other kids on this path before you and there will be another million after. Most of them either went nowhere or turned out to be nothing. Even the successful ones might still flame out or be assholes. What does this mean? It means don’t get high on yourself. Don’t tell yourself a story. Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It’s not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart—notice I didn’t mention those things a single time. It’s safe to assume you’ve already got them covered. What will set you apart, what is rare, is humility, diligence and self-awareness."

"Focus on something that has high value to someone else, be really rigorous in making that assessment, because natural human tendency is wishful thinking, so the challenge to entrepreneurs is telling what's the difference between really believing in your ideals and sticking to them as opposed to pursuing some unrealistic dream that doesn't actually have merit. Be very rigorous in your self analysis, certainly be extremely tenacious, and just work like hell. Put in 80-100 hours every week. All these things improves the odds of success."

"My best tip is to find a reason to learn. Never try to learn for the sake of learning. Thin was the first Ruby webserver based on Rack. Rails was not compatible with Rack at the time, so I had to learn the internals of Rails to build the first ever Rack handler that sits between Rails and Thin. Around 2008, there was some competition from other Ruby webservers trying to be faster than Thin. So I built https://github.com/macournoyer/thin-turbo, a C backend based on libev. I dove pretty deeply in libev, which is the event loop lib used by Node."

I'd be into technology, since all economic growth fundamentally derives from technology development. But I'd be a free agent and keep an open mind. I don't even think of my current gig as part of a career, per se. "Free agent" means do whatever feels right to you rather than getting caught up in what you "should" be doing. For example, entrepreneurs have often done some combination of things - from writing code to blogging to marketing to selling to finance to...

So the first thing you have to do is disconnect from past consensus. I think it's really important to tell people that you're not bound by your past statements or actions.

"There are no speed limits to learning. You can learn in a much faster pace than most people if you're willing to practice diligently and intently, and also use what you learned for something practical. Figure out what you need to learn by going backwards from a finished project; learn as you need. When you're trying to learn how to solve a particular problem or do a particular thing, study the best examples in the world for that specific thing. Be the worst in your group and don't worry about looking foolish. Develop an eye for what is good and what is not, and learn to figure out exactly why something is good or not."
-DHH

"I try to do the best that I can for the only reason that that's fun and rewarding, and then everything else will follow from there. That's my general approach to life."

"The key to creativity is being underemployed. You can waste years because you couldn't waste hours."
